# Contributing to AtlanticWave-SDX Projects

Thank you for taking the time and effort to contribute to
AtlanticWave-SDX.  We would love to have you join the community.

The below summarizes the processes that we try to follow.  At the
moment, they mostly list our aspirations.  We are working towards
making them a reality.

## Reporting Issues

Please check the existing issues, open and closed, before reporting an
issue to see that if anyone else has reported your issue already.

If you find a new issue, please consider reporting it.  Be sure to
include enough details for us to be able to reproduce your issue.

Do you want to implement a feature in AtlanticWave-SDX?  Please create
an issue for that too, and label it as an "enhancement".  Describe the
feature that you would like to see in detail.  Discussing features
this way, *before* you spend a bunch of time working on it, is a good
way to sure that we are better prepared to review the work, give
feedback on it, and to avoid duplicate work.

If you would like to implement the feature, or fix an issue that you
have reported, you should use GitHub pull requests.
